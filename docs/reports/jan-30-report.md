## 🚧 Critical Blockers & Dependencies

### UI Component Dependencies
The following UI components are blocking gameplay features:
- **PromptInputView** - Needed for user to input prompts and access hints
- **LevelCard & LevelGrid** - Needed for level selection screen
- **TargetImageView, CodeExecutionView, CopyAnalysisView** - Needed to display challenge-specific content

### Content Dependencies
- **Additional levels** - Only 60% of planned levels are created, limiting content variety
- **Intermediate/Advanced levels** - All created levels are beginner difficulty

### Integration Dependencies
- **ResultModal enhancements** - Needs to accept scoring service results and display module-specific data
- **Next Level navigation** - Logic exists but not integrated into game screen
- **Per-level progress tracking** - Basic tracking exists but detailed metrics are missing

## 📝 Notes

1. **Backend Services Are Production-Ready** - All scoring services and sync infrastructure are well-implemented with comprehensive error handling and fallback logic.

2. **Content Structure Is Sound** - The 9 created levels demonstrate a good structure that can be replicated for the remaining 6 levels.

3. **UI Components Are the Main Gap** - The majority of remaining work is UI components, which are generally faster to implement than backend services.

4. **No Integration Testing Yet** - While individual components are implemented, end-to-end integration has not been tested.

5. **Documentation Exists** - All implemented code is well-documented with JSDoc comments.

## ✅ Definition of Done Status

A task is considered complete when:
1. ✅ Code compiles without errors
2. ✅ Feature works as described
3. ✅ Code follows project conventions (TypeScript, NativeWind)
4. ✅ Changes are committed with proper commit message
5. ❌ Tested on iOS/Android simulator - **NOT YET DONE**

**Note:** No tasks have been tested on simulators yet, which is a critical final step.
