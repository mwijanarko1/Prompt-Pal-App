# Enhanced Plan: PromptPal Development

This plan details the 6-phase development cycle for PromptPal, a multi-module AI prompt training game with backend integration, targeting a February 15th launch.

## 🎯 Project Overview

**PromptPal** is an interactive mobile game that teaches users to master AI prompting through gamified challenges. The app features three distinct modules with a modern client-server architecture:

### 🖼️ **Image Generation Module**
Users analyze target images and write prompts to recreate them using Gemini AI. The system compares the generated image with the target using computer vision and provides detailed feedback.

### 💻 **Coding Module**
Users see programming requirements or terminal outputs and write prompts to generate functional code. The system executes the generated code in a sandbox environment and scores based on functional correctness.

### ✍️ **Copywriting Module**
Users read marketing briefs and write prompts to generate persuasive copy (headlines, descriptions, etc.). The system analyzes the generated text for tone, style, and effectiveness against the brief requirements.

## 🏗️ **Architecture Overview**

**Client-Server Architecture:**
- **Frontend**: React Native/Expo mobile app with adaptive UI
- **Backend**: Strapi CMS/API server with PostgreSQL database
- **AI Services**: Proxied through backend for security and caching
- **Data Flow**: Client ↔ REST API ↔ AI Services ↔ Database

**Key Benefits:**
- **Security**: API keys hidden server-side, user authentication
- **Scalability**: Centralized content management and user data
- **Analytics**: Server-side tracking of user behavior and progress
- **Cross-Platform**: Sync progress across multiple devices
- **Dynamic Content**: Update levels and challenges without app updates

## 📊 Current Status: Phase 1 Complete ✅
